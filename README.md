# turing-combo-demo

This demo combines autoprognosis and MLFlow by using two docker containers.


Before running the command to create the containers, edit the docker-compose file
and update the paths according to your environment.

To create the containers run:
```docker-compose up -d```

The command will pull the required images from DockerHub.
